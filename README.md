# üç¶ DIVE flavored Laravel stubs

[![Latest Version on Packagist](https://img.shields.io/packagist/v/dive-be/laravel-stubs.svg?style=flat-square)](https://packagist.org/packages/dive-be/laravel-stubs)

- We don't do `down` in migrations.
- Controllers do not extend a base `Controller`.
- Models are not `guarded` because we are mature developers.
- Add type hints wherever possible.
- Removed all of the docblocks.
- All files `declare(strict_types=1)`.
- Traits are defined one per line.
- Console commands return a `SUCCESS` by default.
- `Closures` are `static` wherever possible. Why not squeeze out every bit of performance?
- Fix some minor PSR-12 violations such as `(new MailMessage)` vs. `(new MailMessage())`.
